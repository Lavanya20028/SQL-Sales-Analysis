📊 E-Commerce Sales & Growth Analytics (SQL)
🎯 Business Objective
In this project, I acted as a Lead Data Analyst for a retail venture to solve a critical business problem: lack of visibility into monthly revenue trends and customer performance. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights to help the marketing team focus on high-growth categories and VIP customers. 


🛠️ Tech Stack & Advanced SQL Skills
Database Engine: Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)


Advanced Techniques: * Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used to modularize complex logic for monthly aggregations. 



Window Functions (LAG): Implemented to compare Month-over-Month (MoM) performance. 



Data Aggregation: Leveraged SUM and GROUP BY for revenue tracking across distinct product categories. 


🔍 Analytical Questions Addressed

Revenue Momentum: What is the percentage growth in revenue from one month to the next? 



Product Contribution: Which category is driving the majority of our high-ticket sales? 


Operational Efficiency: How can we use session and order data to reduce manual tracking time? 


💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

Growth Surge: Analyzed a significant revenue spike between February and March, primarily driven by the Electronics category. 

Referral Impact: Based on the referral-driven growth patterns seen in my previous venture work, I identified that structured service delivery correlates with high-ticket retention. 



Business Action: Recommended a targeted marketing focus on Electronics during Q1 to capitalize on high-intent buyer behavior.
